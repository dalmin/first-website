<div class="pera">
  <h3>Comfort zone</h3>
  <p>There was once a time that I would only do what I knew was comfortable for me. Stuck in a continuous cycle of repetitive choices, I knew what was 
    safe when it came to making decisions. I knew what wouldn’t scare me too much, what would keep me glued to the floor of where I already am, 
    and what would shape me into becoming someone who would consistently continue to do what I already knew worked for my life. However, little 
    did I realize at the time that this is not the right path for me.
    After living the same type of life for so long, I decided that there was more for me. Although it was uncomfortable at first, I pushed myself
     to get involved in things that I wouldn’t normally, I decided to open up and talk to other people that I didn’t think I would have the 
     confidence to show my face to, and I started to share more about myself with others that already knew me. By doing these things that I found 
     uncomfortable at first, I pushed myself to become comfortable which only made me strive to want to find more parts of life to open myself up
    to.There was a quote that I came across on a pen in chapters that took my attention, and although I wouldn’t normally pay $10 for a pen, I 
    did for this particular one. The quote was one from Neale Donald Walsch, and it said: “Life begins at the end of your comfort zone.” Reading
    the quote is what made me realize that I was stuck in a life that wasn’t truly mine. I was bound by chains that made me afraid to experience
    life, so I bought the pen and I still have it as a reminder to myself to go beyond my limits.</p>

  <h3>Relex Mode</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>A holiday is an opportunity to journey within. It is also a chance to chill, to relax. It is when I switch on my rest mode.</li>
    <li>To have faith is to trust yourself to the water. When you swim you don't grab hold of the water, because if you do you will sink and drown. Instead you relax, and float.</li>
    <li>If you do what you love, it is the best way to relax.</li>
    <li>I grind and I graft, but I will make sure that I get that time off here and there to unwind and relax and have a life.</li>
